Files for some layouts for my KBD67 rev2. 

Basically in this respository you wil find the files for the layouts for my keyboar.
I have 2 files, one being a VIA compatible layout you can just load to your own keyboard.
The other one is a .c file where i explicitly create the layout and i also create two functions to use the backlight of the pcb as a caps lock.

I have been using this layout for the last year, until i used some case foam to better up the sound of the keyboard and now i just used the VIA layout and a white LED soldered to the caps lock.
